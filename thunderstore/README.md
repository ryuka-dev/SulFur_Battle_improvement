# Battle Improvements
Add some feature to improve the sulfur's battle experience

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CmmmmmmLau/SulFur_Battle_improvement/refs/heads/master/docs/preview.png)

## Maintenance status
This is a temporary maintenance fork. The original author has been contacted, and this fork provides interim maintenance to keep the mod working on the current SULFUR build. It is temporary by design: once the original author ships an official update, this fork will be retired in favor of it.

## Features
All features can be turned off by cfg in BepInEx/Config folder

Battlefield 1/5 style kill message

![hit](https://github.com/CmmmmmmLau/SulFur_Battle_improvement/blob/master/docs/killmessage.gif?raw=true)

Loot drop effect, never miss your loot again.

![lootvfx](https://github.com/CmmmmmmLau/SulFur_Battle_improvement/blob/master/docs/lootdrop_vfx.gif?raw=true)

You can get your weapons back from the donation box.

Of course... you have to lose something...

![deadprotection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CmmmmmmLau/SulFur_Battle_improvement/refs/heads/master/docs/deadprotection.gif)

Bullet behavior reworked. Now your bullets won't be blocked by dead body, and neither will theirs.

![deadbody](https://github.com/CmmmmmmLau/SulFur_Battle_improvement/blob/master/docs/deadbodycollision.gif?raw=true)

Enables the health bar in the dev tools.

Every time you gain some experience on current weapon, your second weapon will also gain some experience.

Reverse mouse scroll.
